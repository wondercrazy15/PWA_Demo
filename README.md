 ## Purpose and Scope 
 
 > Progressive Web App (PWA) is a term used to denote a new software development methodology. Unlike traditional applications, progressive web apps are a hybrid of regular web pages(or websites) and a mobile application. This new application model attempts to combine features offered by most modern browsers with the benefits of mobile experience.


## Push Norificaiton 

> A push notification is a message that pops up on a mobile device. App publishers can send them at any time; users don't have to be in the app or using their devices to receive them. They can do a lot of things; for example, they can show the latest sports scores, get a user to take an action, such as downloading a coupon, or let a user know about an event, such as a flash sale.

- Push notification feature is use for the give use notification on mobile
- when user add any record it will be notify using push notification


## Push Norificaiton 


- The basic concept is that you can queue events within the browser that will fire in your Service Worker when the browser has network connectivity.

- The difference with Background Sync is that the event listeners will fire even if your web app isnâ€™t open in the browser because the sync fires in a Service Worker.

- We can also add a record when we offline and it will be insert database
when network is online
